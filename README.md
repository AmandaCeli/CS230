Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client, and what type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their game Draw It or Lose It into a web-based application that could support multiple teams and users.  The software needed to be scalable, secure, and compatible across multiple operating systems while ensuring only one instance of each game and team existed.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did particularly well translating the client’s requirements into a clear and structured software design document.  The use of UML diagrams and detailed explanations helped communicate system architecture and design decisions effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Creating the design document before writing code helped me identify system components, relationships, and constraints early.  This made the implementation process more efficient and reduced the need for major revisions later in development.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick, and how would you improve it?

I would revise the section addressing security and scalability.  I would improve it by providing more detailed examples of authentication, authorization, and how the system could handle increased user demand.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it important to consider the user’s needs when designing software?

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on usability, performance, and consistency across platforms.  These needs were implemented through centralized services and controlled object creation.  Considering user needs is essential because software must be functional and intuitive in order to be successful.


How did you approach designing software, and what techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar application?

I approached software design using object-oriented principles and modular design.  In the future, I would continue using techniques such as requirement analysis, UML modeling, and iterative design reviews to ensure scalability, maintainability, and alignment with user goals.
